# Spring boot on kubernetes

This repo contains experiments on running a containerized Spring Boot based service on kubernetes.

## Setup a local cluster using k3d
To setup a local cluster with [k3d](https://k3d.io/v5.2.2/#installation), you can follow the instructions on [local-registry](./local-registry/README.md). It will also setup an optional local docker registry.

## Services
On the subfolders, you can find various "micro-services" (pun intended) used as scaffolding for learning Spring and DAPR.
